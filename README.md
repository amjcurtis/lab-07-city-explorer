# City Explorer

**Author**: Andrew Curtis
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if we make more commits past first submission)

## Overview

I will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, I will request data from various third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In the later stages of this week's project I will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Each day of this project I and my pair-programming partner will deploy this back end app as a new instance on Heroku.

I will be hooking up the back-end app to the front-end code base for the client, but I will not be modifying the client-side code in any way.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

* **Languages:** JavaScript, SQL

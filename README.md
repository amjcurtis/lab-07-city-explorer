# City Explorer

**Authors**: Andrew Curtis and Tanner Percival
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if we make more commits past first submission)

## Overview

We will be building out a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, we will request data from various third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In the later stages of this week's project we will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Each day of this project we and my pair-programming partner will deploy this back end app as a new instance on Heroku.

We will be hooking up the back-end app to the front-end code base for the client, but I will not be modifying the client-side code in any way.

## Getting Started
create the server and database -
